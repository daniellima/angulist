# angulist
A project used to learn angular. The main objective is a simple todolist written using Angular.js and Laravel 5

The objective is to have a pure javascript frontend and a Laravel Backed API. I will try to adhere to the RESTfull pattern.

Inspiration has come from todomvc.com and the fact that I love todo lists.

Features:

- [ ] list tasks
- [ ] add tasks
- [ ] mark task done
- [ ] clear done tasks
- [ ] edit task
- [ ] delete task
- [ ] add due date
- [ ] sort by due date
- [ ] add messages to task
